# Kaknas

Kaknas is a JavaFX graphical tool to visualize and manipulate RNA alignments from the [Rfam](https://rfam.org) database. It is powered with [RNArtistCore](https://github.com/fjossinet/RNArtistCore). 

For a given RNA family, Kaknas will allow you to more easily visualize:
* the consensus structure
* the secondary structure for a given species
* the evolution of the secondary structure between species, from a single structural domain to the full 2D
 
For each RNA family available in the [Rfam](https://rfam.org) database, Kaknas plots the secondary structures according to a layout curated and improved with [RNArtist](https://github.com/fjossinet/RNArtist).

### Why is it named "Kaknas"?

RNA alignments from the [Rfam](https://rfam.org) database are described with the [Stockholm format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_format). Kaknas is a [telecommunications tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakn√§stornet) which gives you a fantastic view of Stockholm.
